# Jenkins Docker Dev Environment
This project gives you a Jenkins environment out of the box for your machine. Being more specific, a VM runing a Jenkins Docker contianener with docker on it... yeap Docker inside Docker 


## Getting Started

### Install Vagrant
Basically we rely on Vagrant to provide an environment for any machine (Mac OS, Lunix, Windows).

1. First of all, you need to install a VM Provider, I recommend [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. Then, you gotta install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

### Run your environment!
1. Open your terminal an navigate to the root of this project
2. Start your vm environment
```
vagrant up
```
